    <h1>Chocolate Pots de Creme</h1>
    <img src = "/home/joel/repos/odin-recipes/images/pdc.jpeg" alt = "pots de creme dessert">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rich, decadent, and simple. This classic dessert can be made with a few ingredients, giving you the opportunity to do a lot with so little. 
        I know that it's customary to bore readers to death about a story on how I tried this when I was visiting my long lost uncle in France, but truthfully,
        I was a simple baker, and this was one of the first desserts that I learned how to make. I valued it's simplicity, and few ingredients, which allow the chocolate 
        to really come out here. When making this, please treat yourself, to the best chocolate, dairy products and eggs you can. You deserve it! 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>9 ounces high-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons granulated sugar (add an extra tablespoon if using bitter chocolate</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar</li>
    </li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Place the chocolate in a blender. Whisk the milk, 1 cup cream, egg yolks, granulated sugar and salt in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the spatula and almost boiling, 5 to 6 minutes. </li>
    <li> Immediately pour the milk mixture over the chocolate in the blender. Cover and hold the lid with a thick kitchen towel; blend until combined and smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender as needed. Divide the chocolate mixture among ramekins or small cups and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. </li>
    <li> Whip the remaining 1/2 cup cream and the confectioners' sugar with a mixer or in the blender until soft peaks form. Top the chilled pots de creme with whipped cream. </li>
    </ol>
