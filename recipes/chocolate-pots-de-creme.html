    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rich, decadent, and simple. This classic dessert can be made with a few ingredients, giving you the opportunity to do a lot with so little. 
        I know that it's customary to bore readers to death about a story on how I tried this when I was visiting my long lost uncle in France, but truthfully,
        I was a simple baker, and this was one of the first desserts that I learned how to make. I valued it's simplicity, and few ingredients, which allow the chocolate 
        to really come out here. When making this, please treat yourself, to the best chocolate, dairy products and eggs you can. You deserve it!
