    <p>I had no interest in making brownies until I tried a version of this recipe. The red veins running through the chocolate, 
        complimenting it's flavor and contrasting it to the richness of the brownie became a favorite of mine in no time. I hope you will
        enjoy it as much as I do, especially if you aren't a chocolate lover - this recipe will be the devil's advocate of your palette.
